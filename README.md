Google Maps Mutable Object (MutObj)
====================================

Creates an overlay in Google Maps that can be rotated, resized, and dragged about.

Dependencies
-------------

To accomplish this, we use a number of different libraries.

1. *Google Maps* -- Obviously.
2. *jQuery* -- Because web development isn't sane without jQuery.
3. *jQuery UI* -- Specifically the _Draggable_ and _Resizable_ components, scoped to the `.webonise-gmaps-mutobj` component.
4. *jQuery UI Rotatable* -- A [user contribution](http://github.com/godswearhats/jquery-ui-rotatable) to jQuery UI.
